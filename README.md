# PathPlanningDEM
Modified MATLAB example to compare path planning heuristics on martian digital elevation models

We modify an existing MATLAB example program "Offroad Planning with Digital Elevation Models" that compares Offroad Path Planning heuristics on Digital Elevation Models (DEM). We use publicly available DEMs to implement these path planning heuristics and compare their performance on martian terrain.
